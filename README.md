<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Pokedex project <a name="about-project"></a>


**This first group capstone** is a project where we use the pokemon API to take 6 specific elements, showing in the main page the name of the pokemon and its image.
We implemented a likes function that stores the information in "Involvement API" which is called later to get the information and display it with the amount of likes of each element.
In the same way a button was implemented that opens a popup which shows in greater detail the characteristics of the selected pokemon.
In this popup you can view comments from other people and also create your own comment, all this thanks to the use of Involvement API.
Also two tests were created to verify the operation of the function that displays the number of comments and pokemon displayed in the DOM.
